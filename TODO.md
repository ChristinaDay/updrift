## Internal Job Detail Pages - Implementation Plan

### Overview
Create internal job detail pages (`/jobs/[jobId]`) to keep users in the UpDrift ecosystem instead of immediately redirecting to external job sites. This follows LinkedIn's approach of hosting job details internally while providing external apply links.

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 days)

#### Database & API
- [ ] Create `JobDetail` model in Prisma schema for storing full job data
- [ ] Add API endpoint `GET /api/jobs/[jobId]` to fetch individual job details
- [ ] Implement job data caching strategy (24-hour cache)
- [ ] Create composite job ID system (e.g., `adzuna-123`, `jsearch-456`)

#### Routing & Pages
- [ ] Create `/jobs/[jobId]` route structure
- [ ] Build `JobDetailPage.tsx` component with full job layout
- [ ] Add SEO meta tags and structured data for job pages
- [ ] Implement breadcrumb navigation

#### Components
- [ ] Create `JobDescription.tsx` for displaying full job description
- [ ] Build `JobApplyButton.tsx` with external redirect and tracking
- [ ] Add `JobSaveButton.tsx` for saving jobs within the app
- [ ] Create `CompanyInfo.tsx` component for employer details

#### Data Flow Changes
- [ ] Modify job cards to link to internal pages instead of external sites
- [ ] Update search results to use internal job URLs
- [ ] Implement fallback to external links for jobs without full data
- [ ] Add job data validation and error handling

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (3-4 days)

#### User Engagement
- [ ] Add "Similar Jobs" recommendations section
- [ ] Implement job sharing functionality
- [ ] Create "Recently Viewed Jobs" tracking
- [ ] Add job bookmarking with notes

#### Application Tracking
- [ ] Build application status tracking system
- [ ] Add "Applied" button with status updates
- [ ] Create application history page
- [ ] Implement follow-up reminders

#### Analytics & Insights
- [ ] Add job view tracking
- [ ] Implement salary insights and comparisons
- [ ] Create company information cards
- [ ] Add job market trends display

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1-2 weeks)

#### Job Alerts
- [ ] Create job alert system for similar positions
- [ ] Add email notifications for new matching jobs
- [ ] Implement saved search alerts

#### Interview Tools
- [ ] Add interview preparation resources
- [ ] Create company research tools
- [ ] Implement application status dashboard

#### SEO & Discovery
- [ ] Optimize job pages for search engines
- [ ] Add structured data markup
- [ ] Implement job sitemap generation
- [ ] Create job category pages

### Technical Considerations

#### URL Structure
```
/jobs/[provider]-[jobId] - Individual job pages
/jobs/[provider]-[jobId]/apply - Apply tracking
/jobs/[provider]-[jobId]/save - Save job
```

#### Data Storage Strategy
- **Option A**: Store full job data in database (recommended)
- **Option B**: Fetch from APIs on-demand (faster initial development)
- **Hybrid**: Cache job data for 24 hours, then fetch fresh data

#### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement job data caching
- [ ] Add lazy loading for job descriptions
- [ ] Optimize images and company logos
- [ ] Add service worker for offline job viewing

### User Experience Benefits
1. **Better Engagement**: Users stay in UpDrift ecosystem longer
2. **Rich Information**: Full job descriptions and company details
3. **Application Tracking**: Save jobs and track application status
4. **SEO Value**: Job pages can rank in search engines
5. **Analytics**: Better understanding of user behavior and preferences

### Budget Impact
- **API Calls**: Minimal increase (job data already fetched during search)
- **Database**: Small increase in storage for job details
- **Development**: 1-2 weeks of focused work
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing job data updates and caching

### Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Phase 1 foundation (basic job detail pages)
2. **Medium Priority**: Phase 2 features (similar jobs, application tracking)
3. **Low Priority**: Phase 3 advanced features (alerts, interview tools)

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Job page view time (target: 2+ minutes average)
- [ ] Application rate from job pages (target: 15%+)
- [ ] Job save rate (target: 25%+)
- [ ] Return user rate (target: 40%+)
- [ ] SEO traffic to job pages (target: 10% of total traffic)

### Alternative Approach
If internal job pages prove too complex initially, consider:
- [ ] Keep external links but add "Save Job" functionality
- [ ] Implement job preview modals before external redirect
- [ ] Add application tracking without internal pages
- [ ] Focus on search and discovery features first
