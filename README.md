## Project Rules & Practices

> Use this section to document coding standards, UI/UX conventions, review/QA steps, and any project-specific rules or processes. Update as you learn!

### Coding Standards
- Use theme-aware classes for all UI elements (no hardcoded colors)
- Commit after every major UI or logic change
- Use descriptive commit messages ("Component: what changed and why")
- Prefer functional, composable components

### UI/UX Principles
- Maintain visual consistency across all themes (light, dark, custom)
- Prioritize accessibility (color contrast, keyboard nav, reduced motion)
- Use micro-interactions and subtle effects for delight, not distraction

### Review & QA
- Test all major flows in both light and dark mode
- Check for mobile responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility
- Review for accessibility (screen reader, keyboard, etc.)

### Communication & Workflow
- Document all major decisions and gotchas here
- Use PRs for significant changes; request feedback early
- Keep this README/playbook up to date as the project evolves
