# Figma Wireframing Workflow for UpDrift

This document establishes a systematic workflow for using Figma to plan, design, and document new features while preserving UpDrift's unique cosmic aesthetic elements.

## Workflow Overview

### Design-First Development Process

1. **Feature Planning** → Figma wireframes and specifications
2. **Cosmic Integration** → Plan how new features work with existing elements  
3. **Component Design** → Create Figma components with design tokens
4. **Developer Handoff** → Detailed specifications and implementation notes
5. **Implementation** → Development using Figma specs and existing cosmic system
6. **Validation** → Compare implementation with Figma designs
